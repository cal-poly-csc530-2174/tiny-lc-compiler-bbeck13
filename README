Lambda Calculus to python
Braden Beck (bnbeck@calpoly.edu, bradabraden@gmail.com)

Usage:
   racket LCTranslator.rkt <lambdaCalculs.lc>
outputs lambdaCalculs.py

Assumes python2.7 because that's what was on my computer when I wrote it
(I'd prefer python3 though since in that print is just a function making the translation
even eaiser)

Side note

please add bradabraden@gmail.com to the piazza I can't access it from bnbeck@calpoly
and I can't request to be added from bradabraden because it isn't in the calpoly domain
I'll try calling piazza again to give me my account back but so far they've been to busy
to process my requests.
